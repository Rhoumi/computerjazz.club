bio: |
  Digital Wanderer is the ambient electronic alias of a Berlin-based sound artist who creates expansive, meditative soundscapes. Known for long-form compositions that evolve slowly over time, Digital Wanderer's work often incorporates field recordings from travels across Europe, creating a sense of place and movement within the music.

  The project began as a way to document sonic memories from various locations, gradually evolving into a more structured artistic practice focused on creating immersive listening experiences.

## Artistic Vision

Digital Wanderer's music is designed to create space â€“ both physical and mental. Each composition is carefully constructed to allow listeners to find their own path through the sonic landscape, hence the "wanderer" moniker.

### Recording Philosophy

- **Location-based recordings**: Each release often features recordings from specific geographic locations
- **Minimal processing**: Field recordings are treated with respect, with minimal digital manipulation
- **Extended compositions**: Most tracks are designed for deep listening sessions
- **Analog warmth**: Heavy use of analog processing to maintain organic feel

### Recent Projects

Digital Wanderer has been working on a series of location-based albums, each dedicated to capturing the sonic essence of different European cities. The upcoming collaboration with ComputerJazz Club represents a new direction, blending urban electronic elements with the more pastoral approach typical of Digital Wanderer's solo work.
